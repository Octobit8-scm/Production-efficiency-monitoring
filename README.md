# Production-efficiency-monitoring
## Objective
To visualize production metrics, track machine performance, and identify bottlenecks, downtime, or areas for process improvement. By doing so, manufacturers can enhance efficiency, minimize production delays, and optimize overall productivity.
## Implementation
1. Data Source
 - Machine performance data (e.g., uptime, downtime, throughput).
 - Production time data and product yield per production line (can be sourced from IoT sensors, CSV files, or databases).
2. Libraries Used
 - Seaborn: For statistical analysis and creating visualizations like boxplots and bar charts to assess production performance and detect outliers.
 - Plotly Dash: For creating interactive dashboards to monitor production metrics in real-time.
3. Types of Visualizations
 - Time-series Plots: Track machine uptime and downtime, identifying performance trends over time.
 - Bar Charts: Compare product yields per production line, helping to identify lines with higher or lower productivity.
 - Boxplots: Detect outliers in production time, highlighting any anomalies or inefficiencies in the production process.
## Expected Outcome
By following the implementation steps, manufacturers can:
 - Identify production bottlenecks and downtime across different production lines.
 - Monitor trends in machine performance to schedule maintenance or upgrades.
 - Detect anomalies in production time that might indicate inefficiencies or process issues.
